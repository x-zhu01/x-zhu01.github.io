## Reflections on a visit to Hohenzollern Castle
<br> Hohenzollern is the castle I admire the most because it embodies the ideal Germany in my mind: profound, unassuming, yet possessing tremendous strength and ambition, alongside masculine heroism. Perched atop Höhenburg at an elevation of approximately 855 meters, standing here offers a magnificent visual and spiritual delight, overseeing the breathtaking Schwarzwald region. William II once exclaimed, ”Die Aussicht von der Burg Hohenzollern ist wahrlich eine weite Reise wert.”(The view from Hohenzollern Castle is truly worth a long journey.) Over the past thousand years, the Hohenzollern family has significantly shaped Germany and Europe. As the ancestral seat and birthplace, Prussia's history is beautifully displayed here in a personal way. For me, it's a place to contemplate peace and how to achieve it. Hohenzollern Castle carries a tragic quality where one can witness portraits and sculptures of William II, the crown of the German Reich, and the baton of marshals; these symbols link to the most sorrowful pages of German history. I appreciate tragedy and enjoy pondering issues from a tragic perspective, cultivating a 'tragic foresight.' This awareness isn't fatalistic but aids in understanding human limitations and acting effectively. Tragedy teaches me to fear not just abhorrent things but also unrestrained pursuits. Here, it refers specifically to the unrestrained pursuit of noble things, such as wisdom, technology, social progress, etc. Because boundless belief in the linear progression hypothesis of idealism is always intertwined with arrogance, leading toward expansion and turmoil. Those proclaiming liberty often incite wars; those claiming to defend peace sell weapons. Peace rests on the foundation of realpolitik and balance of power, mostly secured by the fear of mutually assured destruction. Vague values and ideologies struggle to have significant influence within it. Governments across post-Napoleonic Europe suppressed revolutions and national liberation movements. Metternich, hailed as a “reactionary,” laid the foundation for the Vienna System that ensured nearly a century of peace. Yet, in today's economically prosperous, politically democratic, and intellectually free Europe, such an achievement seems like a distant dream. Smart men fear disorder and anarchy as much as tyranny. In international society, I'd prefer an unjust order over a just disorder. Statesmen should realize their aim is the lesser evil, not the ultimate good.

<br>I stayed in Tübingen at night. In 2019, I spent the last summer before the COVID-19 pandemic here. It was a happy time when I never anticipated the monumental changes that would unfold in international relations, interpersonal dynamics, and myself. Over the years, we've witnessed escalating animosity between nations. Even the most optimistic observers have to acknowledge the end of the era of unchecked globalization. Countries continue to fortify barriers in political, economic, and human interactions. Once, we discussed cooperation, openness, and inclusivity. Now, “de-risking” strategies have become the zeitgeist. Technology has shrunk distances, allowing crises to spread rapidly. Conflicts or emergencies in any corner could become strategic challenges affecting the entire globe. However, we lack corresponding global governance. In this increasingly interconnected yet conflict-prone world, the practical wisdom of modern Europe could offer insights. While Britain and the US enjoyed the shelter of oceans, continental European nations had to learn, amid a series of tragic wars, how to coexist and manage differences in this crowded landmass. Realism and pragmatism were once the dominant ideas in Europe. Scholars have the obligation to rediscover these principles and bring them into the fragmented 21st century. The study of modern European history and politics will become increasingly crucial.

<br> (As I wrote this, the computer coincidentally played “Amazing Grace.” Perhaps we've strayed too far, but forgiveness and redemption are still possible. May God have mercy on us.)
